# 🧠 Sales Forecasting System

A machine learning-based graduation project designed to forecast future sales based on historical data. This project was developed during a one-month internship at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI) as part of our Computer Science and AI program at Helwan University.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this project is to help businesses make data-driven decisions by predicting future sales, optimizing inventory, and planning ahead. Our system processes historical sales data, applies predictive models, and visualizes trends for actionable insights.
